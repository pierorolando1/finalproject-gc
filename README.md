## Prerequisites

The only prerequisites are:

- OpenGL, GLUT and GLEW
- C++ Compiler

## Usage

There are two ways of running the program

### Compiling and Executing (By Hand)

To compile the program just run the following command

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o main -lglut -lGLU -lGL -lGLEW
```

And once compiled, simply run the following command to execute it

```bash
./main
```

**P.S:** The above commands are for the g++ compiler

### Using Makefile

If you have all the prerequisites already installed, you can simply run the **make** command to compile and run. But you will need to have the Make installed as well

```
make
```
